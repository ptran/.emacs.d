# Introduction

This is my personal dot-emacs-dot-d directory. All my configurations can be
found in the init.el and all the el files within the config directory. I am
currently using the combination of [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) and
[Pallet](https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet) for package management.

Most of the packages and settings I have are for C++ and Python development, but
I plan on setting up environments for Java and LateX soon.

## Dependencies

* _emacs >24.3_
* _Python >2.6_
 * _rope + ropemacs_
* _libclang_

These emacs settings have been verified to work on __Mac OS X Mavericks__ and
__CentOS 6__.
