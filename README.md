# Introduction

This is my emacs configuration repo. I am currently using the combination of
[Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) and
[Pallet](https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet) to manage my emacs packages. I
have made a copy of my .emacs file within the main folder. However, most of my
settings have been distributed to different el files in the config folder.

The focus of the configuration has been on C++ and Python development, but I
plan on expanding it to other languages such as Java and Julia in the near
future.

## Dependencies

* emacs >24.3
* Python >2.6
 * ropemacs
* clang

These emacs settings have been verified to work on __Mac OS X Mavericks__ and
__CentOS 6__.
