# ptran's Emacs Configuration

This is my personal Emacs configuration. The structure is fairly straightforward. There is a top-level `init.el` that loads in different settings from the `config` directory.

Despite the many packages that I include in my configuration, there are only a few that are essential to my overall workflow.

- [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) - manage all the packages
- [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) - fast completion front-end
- [projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - amazing project management and navigation tools
- [magit](https://github.com/magit/magit) - best git interface ever
- [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) - vim modal editing
